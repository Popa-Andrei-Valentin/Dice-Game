# Dice Game
Similar to romanian game of "barbut" but with some extra rules.
- The first player to acumulate 100 points wins 
- The player doesn't get any points if he doesn't `hold` his points and hits a **1** dice 
- The **1** dice resets the curent score to zero and lets the other player roll the dice.
